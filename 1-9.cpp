// operators:

// what does operator << and = return?
// They return whatever is on the left side of the operator.
// this allows for the chaining of the same operation such as:
// x = y =  5, or cout << "hello" << "world"

// difference between expression and statement
// statement: when we want the program to perfrom an action
// expression: when we want the program to calculate a value
